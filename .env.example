# API Configuration
# IMPORTANT: This file is for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
#
# For local development (localhost):
#   - Leave VITE_API_URL commented out or empty
#   - The app will auto-detect and use http://localhost:5000/api
#
# For production deployment:
#   - Do NOT set VITE_API_URL here
#   - Set it as environment variable during build or on the hosting platform
#   - Default fallback is /api (relative to current origin)

# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
